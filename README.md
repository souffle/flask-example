# Tommy's Example Flask App

## How to Install

You will need to install Python 2.7 and have `pip`, the Python package manager.
Then, to install Flask, run this:

`pip install flask`

## How to Run

Just run `server.py`:

`python server.py`

## Where to look

- I left a lot of comments to explain what's going on.
- For how the back-end works, start at `server.py`
- For how the front-end works, start at `base.html`
